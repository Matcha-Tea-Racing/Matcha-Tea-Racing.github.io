                    <p>Any device that compresses intake air in order to push more air into the engine than if one is not used is classified as a “forced induction” or “boost” device. This excess air allows the engine to be tuned to put more fuel into the engine because more air allows for more fuel to be there as well.</p>

                    <p>By adding this extra fuel more power can be created. The essential principle behind any form of boost is to make a smaller engine push out the same power a larger engine would. Because of this many tuners take to adding them to make their cars go faster.</p>

                    <p>Manufacturers are catching on that they can make small four-cylinder cars that fit within emissions guidelines because they have stuck a turbocharger to them. Thanks to the rise of this, not every vehicle fitted with a turbo is fast, so one might choose to upgrade their stock turbo or supercharger. Or stick one on a “naturally aspirated” (non-boosted) vehicle, because no car is fast enough stock, right?</p>

                    <h2>Turbocharging</h2>
                    <h3>What is a Turbo?</h3>
                    <p>A turbocharger is a forced induction system that uses cooled exhaust gasses to push more air into the engine’s air intake. Thereby allowing you to use more fuel as well, creating more power.</p>

                    <p>Turbos pressurize air before it enters the intake, and this is powered by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gasses from the engine. The cooling occurs through the air- or water-cooled intercooler. Where gasses pass through and are cooled down either by exchanging heat into the ambient air using cooling fins, or into a cooler liquid in liquid cooled setups.</p>

                    <p>There are two sides of the device. The hot-side or exhaust-side is the turbine section of the turbo. Where the force is created from kinetic energy. This energy is transferred to the cold-side or intake-side through the turbine.</p>

                    <P>A compressor on the other side draws in ambient air through the engine’s intake system. Pressurizing it using the compressor driven by exhaust gasses. This is then fed into the combustion chamber. This cooler and more dense air allows the engine to increase the fuel through the fuel to air ratio.</P>

                    <P>Turbocharger performance is directly related to it’s size and ability to compress air. With larger sizes requiring more pressure to spin up before being useful, but also being able to put more pressure into the air, making it denser.</P>

                    <h3>Parts</h3>
                    <p>Making up the cold side are the impeller, diffuser, and housing. The impeller spins in the air, the diffuser helps more the air, and the housing houses all of this.</p>

                    <p>The turbo is connected to a center hub rotating assembly or CHRA. Which holds the shaft that connects the turbine to the compressor. Lighter shafts help to reduce turbo lag by being easier for the exhaust gasses to spin. The bearing is also important as it allows the shaft to spin at speeds as high as 250,000 rpm.</p>

                    <p>Some CHRAs help with cooling by having pipes that engine coolant can flow through. This can stop overheating of the turbo’s lubricating oil.</p>

                    <h3>Types</h3>
                    <h6>Twin Scroll</h6>
                    <p>Two separate exhaust gas inlets are used so the pulsed flow of exhaust due to cylinders firing at different times can be better utilised. Whereas in a standard (single scroll) turbo the pulses from different cylinders interfere with one another. This system uses the scavenging effect of maximising the pulses to pull more energy off the exhaust gasses and thereby help the turbo to be more responsive at low engine rpms (revolutions per minute).</p>

                    <p>Some twin-scroll turbos have different sized nozzles on the exhaust inlets. In order to have low rpm response the steeper angle one is used. The larger nozzle is less angled and better for high rpms.</p>

                    <h6>Variable Geometry</h6>
                    <p>Altering the aspect ratio (inlet radius from center of turbine) of the turbo as conditions change using vanes; the vanes are adjusted on the turbine housing affecting the flow of gasses towards the turbine on the hot side. Some turbos electrically actuate the vanes, others pneumatically.</p>

                    <p>Large aspect ratios cause the turbo to be useless at low speeds, but too small of an aspect ratio and the engine may choke at high speeds and lose power. Using these vanes to adjust the size of the housing keeps the boost at optimal levels throughout the engine’s rpm range.</p>

                    <h6>Electrically Assisted</h6>
                    <p>To reduce lag, an electric motor is included that powers the compressor in addition to the usual power from exhaust gasses. This allows for the compressor to push through more air at all rpms compared to a solely exhaust gas driven turbo.</p>

                    <h3>Single or Twin??</h3>
                    <p>One turbo can be used, which depending on the type and reason for boosting can be quite sufficient. Or a large turbo can be used in order to only provide more power at higher speeds. Although, for most intents and purposes will be inefficient as there is no response for low rpms. However, setting up one sub-optimal is cheaper and still gives you power.</p>

                    <P>The most common multiple turbocharger setup is to run twins, and more turbochargers on a production car is rare (like the Bugatti Veyron with 4). Twin turbo setups use two turbochargers in order to increase the horsepower output of the engine and/or combat lag. The most common setup is to use two identical devices on each half of a V-engine.</P>

                    <h3>Twin Setups</h3>
                    <h6>Parallel</h6>
                    <p>The most common multiple turbocharger setup is to run twins, and more turbochargers on a production car is rare (like the Bugatti Veyron with 4). Twin turbo setups use two turbochargers in order to increase the horsepower output of the engine and/or combat lag. The most common setup is to use two identical devices on each half of a V-engine</p>

                    <p>Such a setup is well suited to V-engines as each engine bank can be separated to each boost device. This is called parallel twin-turbos or biturbo. Although that really just depends on the marketing team.</p>

                    <p>The benefits of this system are being able to use two smaller turbos to work better at low rpms rather than a single larger turbo, but get the same amount of boost. And, that it can simplify the exhaust system in V-shaped engines.</p>

                    <h6>Sequential</h6>
                    <p>Using one smaller turbo for low rpms and a second for higher rpms. Since large turbos are ineffective at low engine speeds the larger turbocharger is only fed a small amount as it is brough up to speed. Most of the exhaust gasses being fed to the small turbo. Once the engine is moving fast enough the exhaust is diverted to the larger turbo which provides boost for such speeds. The smaller one is kept off to avoid choking the engine since it is now ineffective due to the high exhaust flow.</p>

                    <h6>Series</h6>
                    <p>Sitting as somewhat of a midground between parallel and sequential, series setups have turbochargers connected in series. With the gasses feeding into one turbo, then being further compressed by a second turbo.</p>

                    <p>These devices may be the same size, or the second one may be larger. This allows for there to be lots of boost put out by this system. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of lag put out by this system, so it is not a great setup for most applications.</p>

                    <h3>Lag</h3>
                    <p>The lag that I have made mention to is the time between when you hit the throttle and when the turbo begins adding power. In the early days of turbo technology this was a big issue as it was hard for drivers to predict when it would kick. Getting a ton of power right in the middle of a corner proves quite disastrous. Therefore, most motorbikes don’t have turbos, it’s hard to put modern anti-lag on them.</p> 
                   
                    <p>This delay is caused by how much air it takes for the hot-side to spin fast enough to get the compressor on the cold-side to pressurize enough air to make boost. Nowadays we have smaller turbos that still make power, and ways to mitigate lag.</p>

                    <h3>Combatting Lag</h3>
                    <ul>lower rotational inertia of turbocharger.</ul>
