                    <p>Any device that compresses intake air in order to push more air into the engine than if one is not used is classified as a “forced induction” or “boost” device. This excess air allows the engine to be tuned to put more fuel into the engine because more air allows for more fuel to be there as well.</p>

                    <p>By adding this extra fuel more power can be created. The essential principle behind any form of boost is to make a smaller engine push out the same power a larger engine would. Because of this many tuners take to adding them to make their cars go faster.</p>

                    <p>Manufacturers are catching on that they can make small four-cylinder cars that fit within emissions guidelines because they have stuck a turbocharger to them. Thanks to the rise of this, not every vehicle fitted with a turbo is fast, so one might choose to upgrade their stock turbo or supercharger. Or stick one on a “naturally aspirated” (non-boosted) vehicle, because no car is fast enough stock, right?</p>

                    <h2>Turbocharging</h2>
                    <h3>What is a Turbo?</h3>
                    <p>A turbocharger is a forced induction system that uses cooled exhaust gasses to push more air into the engine’s air intake. Thereby allowing you to use more fuel as well, creating more power.</p>

                    <p>Turbos pressurize air before it enters the intake, and this is powered by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gasses from the engine. The cooling occurs through the air- or water-cooled intercooler. Where gasses pass through and are cooled down either by exchanging heat into the ambient air using cooling fins, or into a cooler liquid in liquid cooled setups.</p>

                    <p>There are two sides of the device. The hot-side or exhaust-side is the turbine section of the turbo. Where the force is created from kinetic energy. This energy is transferred to the cold-side or intake-side through the turbine.</p>

                    <P>A compressor on the other side draws in ambient air through the engine’s intake system. Pressurizing it using the compressor driven by exhaust gasses. This is then fed into the combustion chamber. This cooler and more dense air allows the engine to increase the fuel through the fuel to air ratio.</P>

                    <P>Turbocharger performance is directly related to it’s size and ability to compress air. With larger sizes requiring more pressure to spin up before being useful, but also being able to put more pressure into the air, making it denser.</P>

                    <h3>Parts</h3>
                    <p>Making up the cold side are the impeller, diffuser, and housing. The impeller spins in the air, the diffuser helps more the air, and the housing houses all of this.</p>

                    <p>The turbo is connected to a center hub rotating assembly or CHRA. Which holds the shaft that connects the turbine to the compressor. Lighter shafts help to reduce turbo lag by being easier for the exhaust gasses to spin. The bearing is also important as it allows the shaft to spin at speeds as high as 250,000 rpm.</p>

                    <p>Some CHRAs help with cooling by having pipes that engine coolant can flow through. This can stop overheating of the turbo’s lubricating oil.</p>

                    <h3>Types</h3>
                    <h6>Twin Scroll</h6>
                    <p>Two separate exhaust gas inlets are used so the pulsed flow of exhaust due to cylinders firing at different times can be better utilised. Whereas in a standard (single scroll) turbo the pulses from different cylinders interfere with one another. This system uses the scavenging effect of maximising the pulses to pull more energy off the exhaust gasses and thereby help the turbo to be more responsive at low engine rpms (revolutions per minute).</p>

                    <p>Some twin-scroll turbos have different sized nozzles on the exhaust inlets. In order to have low rpm response the steeper angle one is used. The larger nozzle is less angled and better for high rpms.</p>

                    <h6>Variable Geometry</h6>
                    <p>Altering the aspect ratio (inlet radius from center of turbine) of the turbo as conditions change using vanes; the vanes are adjusted on the turbine housing affecting the flow of gasses towards the turbine on the hot side. Some turbos electrically actuate the vanes, others pneumatically.</p>

                    <p>Large aspect ratios cause the turbo to be useless at low speeds, but too small of an aspect ratio and the engine may choke at high speeds and lose power. Using these vanes to adjust the size of the housing keeps the boost at optimal levels throughout the engine’s rpm range.</p>

                    <h6>Electrically Assisted</h6>
                    <p>To reduce lag, an electric motor is included that powers the compressor in addition to the usual power from exhaust gasses. This allows for the compressor to push through more air at all rpms compared to a solely exhaust gas driven turbo.</p>

                    <h3>Single or Twin??</h3>
                    <p>One turbo can be used, which depending on the type and reason for boosting can be quite sufficient. Or a large turbo can be used in order to only provide more power at higher speeds. Although, for most intents and purposes will be inefficient as there is no response for low rpms. However, setting up one sub-optimal is cheaper and still gives you power.</p>

                    <P>The most common multiple turbocharger setup is to run twins, and more turbochargers on a production car is rare (like the Bugatti Veyron with 4). Twin turbo setups use two turbochargers in order to increase the horsepower output of the engine and/or combat lag. The most common setup is to use two identical devices on each half of a V-engine.</P>

                    <h3>Twin Setups</h3>
                    <h6>Parallel</h6>
                    <p>The most common multiple turbocharger setup is to run twins, and more turbochargers on a production car is rare (like the Bugatti Veyron with 4). Twin turbo setups use two turbochargers in order to increase the horsepower output of the engine and/or combat lag. The most common setup is to use two identical devices on each half of a V-engine</p>

                    <p>Such a setup is well suited to V-engines as each engine bank can be separated to each boost device. This is called parallel twin-turbos or biturbo. Although that really just depends on the marketing team.</p>

                    <p>The benefits of this system are being able to use two smaller turbos to work better at low rpms rather than a single larger turbo, but get the same amount of boost. And, that it can simplify the exhaust system in V-shaped engines.</p>

                    <h6>Sequential</h6>
                    <p>Using one smaller turbo for low rpms and a second for higher rpms. Since large turbos are ineffective at low engine speeds the larger turbocharger is only fed a small amount as it is brough up to speed. Most of the exhaust gasses being fed to the small turbo. Once the engine is moving fast enough the exhaust is diverted to the larger turbo which provides boost for such speeds. The smaller one is kept off to avoid choking the engine since it is now ineffective due to the high exhaust flow.</p>

                    <h6>Series</h6>
                    <p>Sitting as somewhat of a midground between parallel and sequential, series setups have turbochargers connected in series. With the gasses feeding into one turbo, then being further compressed by a second turbo.</p>

                    <p>These devices may be the same size, or the second one may be larger. This allows for there to be lots of boost put out by this system. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of lag put out by this system, so it is not a great setup for most applications.</p>

                    <h3>Lag</h3>
                    <p>The lag that I have made mention to is the time between when you hit the throttle and when the turbo begins adding power. In the early days of turbo technology this was a big issue as it was hard for drivers to predict when it would kick. Getting a ton of power right in the middle of a corner proves quite disastrous. Therefore, most motorbikes don’t have turbos, it’s hard to put modern anti-lag on them.</p> 
                   
                    <p>This delay is caused by how much air it takes for the hot-side to spin fast enough to get the compressor on the cold-side to pressurize enough air to make boost. Nowadays we have smaller turbos that still make power, and ways to mitigate lag.</p>

                    <h3>Combatting Lag</h3>
                    <ul>lower rotational inertia of turbocharger.</ul>
                    <ul>Changing aspect ratio of turbocharger (variable geometry).</ul>
                    <ul> Increasing air pressure of compressor discharger, and wastegate response.</ul>
                    <ul>Reducing bearing frictional losses.</ul>
                    <ul>Variable-nozzle, or twin-scroll turbos.</ul>
                    <ul>Decreasing volume of piping from turbo to intercooler.</ul>
                    <ul>Using multiple turbos with sequential or parallel setups.</ul>
                    <ul>Turbo spool valve to increase exhaust gas flow speed to turbine.</ul>
                    <ul>Use a butterfly valve to force exhaust gas through a smaller passage in turbo inlet.</ul>
                    <ul>Electric turbo/hybrid turbo.</ul>
                    <ul>Antilag systems...</ul>

                    <h3>Antilag</h3>
                    <p>Working to reduce the lag before the turbocharger spins up. The basic function is to delay (retard) ignition timing and add extra fuel to balance the loss in combustion efficiency by increasing pressure at the charging side of the turbo. To do this more fuel is added to the fuel to air mixture. And pushed through the exhaust valves, combusting in the exhaust system before the turbo.</p>
                    
                    <p>This tends to be used on race cars as they are able to ignore most reliability, noise, and exhaust restraints applied to street cars. As well, rally cars famously use it in order to keep the turbo ready during the long periods of off-throttle that are common in the sport.</p>

                    <p>To accomplish an anti-lag system (ALS) you need an air bypass. Either a throttle bypass with an external bypass valve or a solenoid valve that holds the throttle 12 to 20 degrees open. Or, use a bypass valve that feeds charged air directly to the exhaust manifold.</p>

                    <h3>Blow-Off Valves</h3>
                    <p>These prevent excessive pressure on the turbo when the throttle is closed at high rpms (like changing gears). And, because of this reduction in pressure it also helps the turbo spin up quicker. This happens by opening its valve and allowing the air to vent out either to the ambient air in an atmospheric venting system. Or a recirculating type will send air back to the intake upstream of the turbo where it isn’t pressurized.</p>

                    <p>Blow-off valves work by connecting a vacuum line to the air intake after the throttle, a valve is installed before the throttle. When the throttle is open the pressure is equal on both sides of the BOVs pistons, so it stays closed. But, when the throttle closes the pressure after the throttle is lower than the pressure before it, which causes the valve to open.</p>

                    <h3>Wastegates</h3>
                    <p>The wastegate in a turbocharged car controls exhaust flow to the turbo’s hot side. This is used to regulate maximum boost pressure. There are two types of wastegates.</p>

                    <p>One is the external wastegate which is used on turbos that do not include one internally. The manifold of the turbo must include a runner to the wastegate. Due to the extra parts they tend to be more precise. Pneumatics control the opening of the valve, although some use butterfly valves. The blades of the turbo trying to vent air cause you to get those beautiful flutter sounds with this system.</p>

                    <p>Other turbos have a built-in bypass valve to allow pressure to bypass the turbine into the exhaust. These systems are simpler than the external ones and are more compact. Although, you are limited in how much exhaust pressure you can bleed off because of the small size of the valve.</p>

                    <p>Most modern wastegates are controlled either by pneumatic or electric systems. These integrate a boost controller to choose their maximum boost. This is important to prevent the engine from pushing too much power through the engine and turbo, causing critical failures and damage.</p> 

                    <h3>Installation of a Naturally Aspirated Engine</h3>
                    <h6>Things to Worry About</h6>
                    <p>Before you can even consider what parts to investigate you must determine if your engine can handle the boost. You must decide if your engine is in good condition and if it was built strongly enough to handle the extra power. Look at where your engine is weak online, people will have posted about it. Testing the compression and oil of your engine is also a necessary precaution. Donut Media did a good video on this, and honestly their whole turbo series is quite solid. Keep in mind that checking the health of the engine applies to all forms of boost.</p>

                    <p>To hook up a turbocharger you will have to change out the exhaust system, quite possibly the manifold, and add a downpipe. The tubing can get rather nasty, and you also must consider the heat that will inevitably build up.</p>

                    <p>Hooking up an extra oil line and possibly coolant line are needed steps, and this will put some extra drain on your engine oil and coolant. In addition, a better fuel system is key to use all the extra air you are pushing into the engine. This will possibly include injectors, maybe a whole fuel rail, and perhaps the pump too. It all depends on the age and power of everything on your engine.</p>

                    <p>Of course, as with all boost, you will need to get your engine tuned. Otherwise, it is almost pointless to stick a turbo to it. If you neglect going to a tuner you risk the safety of your engine, and all the money you spent on the parts is no longer worth the power output they were rated for. So, you have paid for far less than you are getting.</p>

                    <h3>Upgrading a Turboed Vehicle</h3>
                    <p>Working off of a stock system tends to be easier than fully building something. This is true for turbochargers as well. Your options are just about as open if not more so as upgrading from a naturally aspirated system. Dropping in a larger turbo can be quite simple with looking at what fits with the OEM plumbing and wiring.</p>

                    <p>Changing out the BOW and wastegate can change how your turbocharger operates. Cooling can always be upgraded with a larger or better intercooler. Water spray, methane injection, or just better plumbing. Most Turboed cars have a lot of support for tunes, and just changing little things can open a lot more performance. Even from an otherwise stock engine.</p>

                    <h3>Buying a Turbocharger</h3>
                    <p>Ratings and sizes do differ brand to brand. So, size does not always determine power. Because brands have different features and build their products to different standards. Talk to a tuner because they will understand what will work with your goals and if the engine can handle them.</p>

                    <p>Although, you can do a lot of the research yourself and determine what is realistic. Having the knowledge of your car’s strengths and weaknesses, and an idea of what power you wish to push for what reasons, start the search for the turbo itself, then the accompanying parts.</p>

                    <p>Sized go by either the flange size or compressor diameter. T4 and T6 are examples of flange sizes. The lower the number, generally the larger the flange is. They do mean specific measurements, but that is a whole learning curve in itself. You can figure out which one you need simply by googling the sizing of the turbo you are looking at.</p>

                    <p>Flange sizing also depends on whether it is divided by a cross section. Divided flanges allow you to use a fully designed exhaust that can help your turbo to spool faster by directing the hot exhaust air. However, without a built exhaust it tends in most cases to simply limit the air going into the turbo. Sort of like the restrictors used in races to keep the power down on some cars for fair play.</p>

                    <p>Universal turbos can be used with many different cars, pipes, and plumbing designs. Engine-specific and even chassis-specific turbos do exist and will nearly perfectly fit in with an already Turboed car. These offer increased performance or tuning options above what the stock turbo can do.</p>

                    <p>Your air to fuel ratio, peak engine rpm, and other stats can help you figure out the turbo and parts you should buy using an online calculator tool like that on Garret’s website. Some are found here, and here.</p>
