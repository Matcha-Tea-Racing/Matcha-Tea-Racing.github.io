                    <p>Any device that compresses intake air in order to push more air into the engine than if one is not used is classified as a “forced induction” or “boost” device. This excess air allows the engine to be tuned to put more fuel into the engine because more air allows for more fuel to be there as well.</p>

                    <p>By adding this extra fuel more power can be created. The essential principle behind any form of boost is to make a smaller engine push out the same power a larger engine would. Because of this many tuners take to adding them to make their cars go faster.</p>

                    <p>Manufacturers are catching on that they can make small four-cylinder cars that fit within emissions guidelines because they have stuck a turbocharger to them. Thanks to the rise of this, not every vehicle fitted with a turbo is fast, so one might choose to upgrade their stock turbo or supercharger. Or stick one on a “naturally aspirated” (non-boosted) vehicle, because no car is fast enough stock, right?</p>

                    <h2>Turbocharging</h2>
                    <h3>What is a Turbo?</h3>
                    <p>A turbocharger is a forced induction system that uses cooled exhaust gasses to push more air into the engine’s air intake. Thereby allowing you to use more fuel as well, creating more power.</p>

                    <p>Turbos pressurize air before it enters the intake, and this is powered by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gasses from the engine. The cooling occurs through the air- or water-cooled intercooler. Where gasses pass through and are cooled down either by exchanging heat into the ambient air using cooling fins, or into a cooler liquid in liquid cooled setups.</p>

                    <p>There are two sides of the device. The hot-side or exhaust-side is the turbine section of the turbo. Where the force is created from kinetic energy. This energy is transferred to the cold-side or intake-side through the turbine.</p>

                    <P>A compressor on the other side draws in ambient air through the engine’s intake system. Pressurizing it using the compressor driven by exhaust gasses. This is then fed into the combustion chamber. This cooler and more dense air allows the engine to increase the fuel through the fuel to air ratio.</P>

                    <P>Turbocharger performance is directly related to it’s size and ability to compress air. With larger sizes requiring more pressure to spin up before being useful, but also being able to put more pressure into the air, making it denser.</P>

                    <h3>Parts</h3>
                    <p>Making up the cold side are the impeller, diffuser, and housing. The impeller spins in the air, the diffuser helps more the air, and the housing houses all of this.</p>
