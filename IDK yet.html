However, with a larger following I will be able to try new things with my page. Here's some ideas I have...</span>

                <p>I do enjoy making content on cars, and interacting with others about my stuff is always great. But what would I want to add to my current content?</p>
                <p>I would look forward to the challenge of selling some products on the side. That would also help make this page more feasible and reasonable. Although more than the money would be the fact that it's somewhat of a dream to be able to make content and products in a niche I have interest in.</p>
                <p>In working on my own car and trying different things I have gained some amount of skill working with different materials, design, and a weird amount with stickers and heat transfer. Like most, I have also had to pay premiums on some things that I feel could be sold a lot cheaper. I feel that for some products that are simple to manufacture there are easy ways to bring down the cost on the consumer's end. And, if given a shot by having grown a following I think I would definitely like to try and accomplish that.</p>
